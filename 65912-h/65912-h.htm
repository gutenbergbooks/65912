<h2 class="nobreak">&#8220;SWAT THE FLY!&#8221;</h2>
</div>


<p><i>A garden in the rear of a laboratory for animal experimentation.
A high red-brick wall encloses the garden, into which, at the upper
right-hand corner, juts the granite laboratory building. The interior
of the laboratory is brilliantly white. From it a door opens upon
the garden. Beside the door, hanging from a wrought-iron bracket,
is a globe in which are electric bulbs. The lights are turned on by
pressing a button in the framework of the door.</i></p>

<p><i>In the garden wall, at left, is a wide door leading to a city street.
In the rear wall is a square, window-like opening through which
can be seen the Horse&#8217;s standing-stall. The Monkey&#8217;s house is in
the lower right-hand corner of the garden. Directly across from it
is the kennel of the Dog. The Rabbit&#8217;s hutch is placed against the
rear wall, close to the square opening. The front of the hutch is
screened with wire netting.</i></p>

<p><i>The garden is covered by a lawn. Flowers grow against its walls,
as well as in the corners made by the meeting of wall and building.
Vines climb the bricks on either side of the street door. Above the
walls, on every side, bend the branches of trees. At the center of the
garden is a low stone bench.</i></p>

<p><i>It is late evening. The garden is only star-lit. Out of the gloom
come the sleepy bark of the Dog, the crunching and stamping of
the Horse, as he feeds, and the cross chatter of the Monkey. The
tiny bell, which the Cat wears on her collar, tinkles faintly.</i></p>

<p><i>Suddenly the street door opens, and the flash of a pocket search-light
is turned upon the garden. The Woman Inspector appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
in the doorway. She wears a coat-suit, a neckpiece formed of the
skin of a fox, and a hat trimmed with pheasant feathers. She
throws her light upon the Monkey&#8217;s house: upon the door of the
laboratory: upon the opening in the rear wall. The back of the
Horse appears above the sill of the opening. The light travels to
the Rabbit&#8217;s hutch, disclosing a mound of snow-white fur.</i></p>

<p><i>The Inspector enters quickly and goes to the Dog, who is lying
down, his back curved against the entrance to the kennel. The
Inspector turns her light upon him. He moves.</i></p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Leans to peer into the kennel.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Here! Let me look at you. A bandage! Oh, poor fellow!
That Doctor&#8217;s been torturing you! (<i>The Dog growls.</i>) There!
There! (<i>Pats the Dog, and goes to the hutch.</i>) A rabbit!
(<i>Makes a brief examination; goes to the opening in the wall and
looks through at the Horse, flashing her light over him. Comes
down quickly to the Monkey. He is lying just within the door of
his house. She drops on one knee.</i>) Well, monkey! What&#8217;s
that Doctor been doing to YOU? (<i>Reaches in.</i>) Been putting
a steel gag on you? Oh, the poor foot! (<i>Soothingly, as the
Monkey moves and chatters.</i>) There, now! Lie still!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Calls from the laboratory.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Here, Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>The Inspector puts out her pocket-flash, springs up,
and hides behind the Monkey&#8217;s house. The Doctor
enters, and presses the electric button beside the laboratory
door. The globe floods the garden with light. The
Doctor wears a sack suit, but no hat.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Here, Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! (<i>Looks about the garden.</i>) Well,
how&#8217;s everybody? (<i>Goes to the opening in the wall, and reaches
to pat the Horse.</i>) Hello! How&#8217;s the nice old boy? (<i>Turns
toward the hutch.</i>) And how&#8217;s little Bunny! Eh?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>The Boy enters from the street. He is wearing
pajamas. In his right hand, wrapped in paper, he
carries a bone. In the circle of his left arm he has a
banana, which he holds against him; in his left hand
are an apple and a carrot. He sees the Doctor and
halts timidly. The Doctor turns from the hutch and
sees the boy.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Good evening, young man! Where did YOU come from?</p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>I came from my bed. (<i>Backs a step and puts the bone behind
him.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>And what are you doing out of your bed?</p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>I&#8217;m feeding your animals. (<i>Holds out his right hand to show
the bone.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Feeding my animals! Why&mdash; &mdash;!</p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>My mother says you starve &#8217;em. So,&mdash;here&#8217;s a bone for the
dog, an&#8217; a carrot for the rabbit, an&#8217; a&#8217; apple for the horse, an&#8217; a
banana for the monkey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Laughs and accepts the bone.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>All right. (<i>Goes to the kennel, the Boy following, and looks in.</i>)
Hey, dog! Just gnaw on this fine big bone. (<i>To the boy.</i>) And
how did you find your way here, at this time of night?</p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>I followed my mother.</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Why, your mother isn&#8217;t here!</p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>Oh, yes, she is. Somewhere. (<i>Looks behind the kennel.</i>) I
saw her come in. Oh, Mother! (<i>Looks behind the Monkey&#8217;s
house.</i>) Hello, mother! (<i>To the Doctor.</i>) Here she is!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>The Inspector stands up.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Madam, what are you doing in this garden?</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>Examining these animals.</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Why should you sneak and hide?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>The Boy goes to his mother.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>Let me introduce myself. (<i>Opens her coat, displaying a metal
badge pinned on her breast.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>So you&#8217;re a spy!</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>I&#8217;m an inspector!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen you before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on you.</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Well, go ahead! What is it you want to know?</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>I want to know what you do to these poor, dumb creatures.</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>I use them to fight the diseases carried by flies.</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Sneeringly.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Oh, you vivisectionists have a FINE excuse for your cruelty!
Flies!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Yes, flies! When all the flies are dead, we doctors will be out
of a job. For now we know that&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>Please come back to the animals.</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Shrugs, crosses to the Monkey.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Well, this monkey here is&mdash;(<i>The Monkey chatters angrily.
The Doctor falls back, motioning the Inspector and the Boy to
retreat.</i>) Look out! He&#8217;s bad-tempered!</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>Ah! You needn&#8217;t tell me how you treat HIM! (<i>The Doctor
turns away.</i>) And what about that helpless rabbit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Goes to the hutch.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The rabbit furnishes me with typhoid serum. And the neck of
my horse is full of the serum that cures diphtheria. See!
(<i>Takes a small case from a pocket.</i>) I&#8217;ll take some serum&mdash;just
to show you. (<i>Leans through the opening.</i>) Here, back!
Back up! Whoa, now!</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>Oh, don&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t bear it! Don&#8217;t! (<i>The Horse stamps.
She covers her eyes.</i>) Don&#8217;t, I say! Oh, I&#8217;ll have you arrested
for this!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>There! (<i>Turns.</i>) You see what THAT amounts to.</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Faces him.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Oh, don&#8217;t try to fool me! You hurt him!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Not more than the flick of a whip. (<i>Puts the case away.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Triumphantly.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>There you are! The flick of a whip! What do you doctors
care about the agony of your poor victims!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t cause pain unless it&#8217;s necessary.</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>Necessary! You shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to cause an animal
ANY pain!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Oh! Then, of course, you&#8217;re a vegetarian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>I am not!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Well, I AM! You talk about pain! Do you know how lambs
are killed? And cattle? Do you know anything about
slaughtering hogs? THERE&#8217;S pain for you!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Angrily.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Oh, I know what you mean! But let me tell you something:
When my husband hunts, he gives an animal a chance for its
life. And if he kills, he kills quick. But you&mdash;you mutilate
in the name of science. You tie down your victims&mdash;and
torture!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>I use ether and chloroform. But your husband&mdash;when he pulls
a trout from the stream, it dies of suffocation.</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>To the Boy, irritably.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Don&#8217;t lean against me like that!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>And when your husband goes shooting, he doesn&#8217;t find every
bird that he wounds.</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>He finds as many as he can.</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Ha! As many as he can! But the ones he DOESN&#8217;T find!
Are they chloroformed? And what about the animals that
die in traps? And the birds that are snared? (<i>He points
at the Inspector.</i>) How about that fox? That pheasant?</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>You&#8217;re insulting!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Madam, you&#8217;re a fine Inspector! Here you stand, admitting
that your husband kills for pleasure! And you&#8217;re tricked out
in the skin and the feathers of dumb creatures. Look at that
poor head! Those little paws! And yet you spy on a man
who causes suffering only to save human life!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>The Boy coughs, and leans heavily against his
mother.</i>)</p>

what nonsense!</p>

<p class="center">DOCTOR</p>

<p>Madam, go home. And take care of your boy!</p>

<p class="center">INSPECTOR</p>

<p>You needn&#8217;t worry about my boy. (<i>She draws the Boy to her.</i>)</p>

<p>No! Your hands are stained with the blood of the innocent!

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
